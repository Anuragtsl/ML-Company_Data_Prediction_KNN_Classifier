# ML-Company_Data_Prediction_KNN_Classifier

I have created Machine Learning Model With KNN Classifier for Company's Classified Data Prediction.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Pandas](), [Matplotlib](), [Seaborn](), and [Sklearn]() for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# Project Overview

I've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.

We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

Let's grab it and use it!
